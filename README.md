# Cats vs Dogs Classification

This project focuses on building a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify images of cats and dogs. The dataset used is the famous Cats vs Dogs dataset.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately classify images of cats and dogs. The dataset consists of thousands of images of cats and dogs, and we aim to train a CNN model that can distinguish between the two classes with high accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Cats vs Dogs dataset, which contains labeled images of cats and dogs. It is available for download from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data).

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- OpenCV

## Approach

1. **Data Preparation**: The dataset is downloaded and preprocessed to extract image features and labels.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Exploratory data analysis is performed to gain insights into the distribution of classes, image dimensions, etc.

3. **Model Building**: A convolutional neural network (CNN) model is constructed using TensorFlow and Keras.

4. **Model Training**: The model is trained on the training dataset with appropriate hyperparameters.

5. **Model Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated on the test dataset to measure its performance.

## Results

The CNN model achieved an accuracy of approximately 61.59% on the test dataset.

## Usage

To run the code:

1. Clone this repository:
